# List of my dotfiles
Auto update each day 😁

## Including
### Code editor
- Vscode with Neovim integration
VSCode with neovim binding, have the vast library of vscode with the power of Neovim. Best of both worlds 🏆🏆
- Lunarvim
Full fledged and have IDE like capabilities 💪💪
- Vim
Lightweight vim for fast text editing 🚀🚀

### Terminal
- Fish
Minimal configuration needed for powerful terminal. The best terminal for linux/mac in my opinion 🐟🐟
- Zsh
Using Oh My ZSH for the configuration, I recommend using fish instead
- Bash
Tbh, I very rarely used this lol
